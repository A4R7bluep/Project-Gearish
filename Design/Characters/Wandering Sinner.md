## Gameplay: 
* Lowest Health, but can respawn (for meter) once per match 
* First form is slow with big damage, probably demonic in form 
* Second form is quick, with less damage per hit but faster movement and attack speed
## Appearance:
* (base) First form: Dark demon covered in bright white bandages. Rather large but not big body. Movements are solid, not flowy. Has a scattergun with some sort of special mechanic
* (base) Second form: White skeleton wearing a dark cloak (think grim reaper), cloak is made of shadow, and he moves fluidly (think Eddie). Only attacks melee. 
## Quirks:
* When killed in second form, dissipates into the air and skeletal features turn to dust.
* First form is loud and bombastic, second form talks exclusively in whispers and is shy
## Possible Supers (VERY ROUGH):
* Having an ult that does two separate things depending on form 
* Having an ult that that changes forms/changes forms early for some sort of bonus 
* Separate win animations and lines depending on form
