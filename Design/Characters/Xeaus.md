## Stage: Verdant Grove - infinite/looping?

## Mechanics
- #### Blood Meter
	- Consumes all blood built up in the dagger
	- Pops when blood meter is full
	- gives a little time before taking damage from not having blood
	- Gains blood when hitting a dagger move, but not on block
	- Blood goes down over time
	- Increases damage and defense for 3 seconds
	- Gives more block stun
	- All attacks apply demonic fire state, even on block
	- ***Note: Should it apply demonic fire state?***

## Mechanic Overrides
- Air dash like Zato's where it allows you to fly in the air, in bat form
- Shadow Step: Step dash instead of run, extra invincibility, appears to hide into the shadows out of nowhere

## Weakness
